# water-management
I think it is difficult to there is another subject that involves so many other profession as water management.
During my 14 years of studying and working in water conservancy, I have been exposed to at least the following subjects:
1. Meteorology (prediction and analysis of precipitation);
2. Geology (development and evolution of groundwater, river landforms, etc.);
3. Engineering (dams, embankments, water conveyance tunnels, diversion canals);
4. Environment (impact of sewage discharge, sewage treatment);
5. Mathematics (laminar flow, turbulent flow, fluid mechanics, statistics);
6. Politics (water distribution across municipalities, provinces or national rivers);
7. Ecology (river ecological flow, dam fishway design);
8. Agriculture (agricultural water needs, farmland irrigation);
9. Urban construction (water supply and drainage design);
10. Disaster prevention (how to deal with floods and droughts);
